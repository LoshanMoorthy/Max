# Max
Algorithms and Data structures
In this problem, the input to your program is an array of N positive integers, and your program must output the largest integer in the input.
Concretely, you must implement a public method named computeMaximum that takes an ArrayList<Integer> input as argument and returns an int.
Input constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000
- Each element is between 1 and 100 000
